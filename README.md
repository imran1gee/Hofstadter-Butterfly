# Hofstadter-Butterfly
In this repository, the code for Hofstadter butterfly of square lattice and monolayer graphene are stored. I can also calculte the Chern numbers and plot the Berry curvature field. This can be done for both single bands and multiplets of bands.  
The Wannier diagrams are intentionally put in separate folder.
